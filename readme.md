### How to Run
Starting this sample is possible either by running the App (F5) or
debugging (F7+F10). Setting breakpoint on the first row inside the 'main'
function allows debugging step-by-step after 'Engine.OnStarted' event.
Results can be seen in the image viewer on the DevicePage.
To run this sample a device with SICK Algorithm API is necessary.
For example InspectorP or SIM4000 with latest firmware. Alternatively the
Emulator on AppStudio 2.2 or higher can be used.
